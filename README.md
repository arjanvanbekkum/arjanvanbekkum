Hi üëãüèª,

```quote
To really make a difference you have got to stand out in the crowd 
```

## Expertise/Competence
<div class="card"> 
Application LifeCycle Management, Developing, Architecture
</div>

## Passion
<div class="card">
To help customers go where they never went before by using (new) technology. The possibilities are endless and beyond our imagination
</div>

## Talent
<div class="card">
Listen, ask, learn, challenge to do more than just getting the job done. 
</div>

## My source of inspiration
<div class="card">
Inspiration is everywhere: using cool new technology, having a drink with your friends, walking around or doing a workshop so open your mind by thinking there is no box. You should always go your own way, be who you are, talk about your passion, that's the most inspiring.. 
</div>

## This makes me happy
<div class="card">
Enjoying time with my wife and two boys and among other things having a good cup of coffee, listening to music, reading a good book, going to the beach and watching Formula 1. Learning new cool stuff by working with anyone who is passionate about what they do, no matter if it is work or not. 
</div>

## My ultimate Epic Shit moment
<div class="card">
On a personal note my two boys being born and working with Xpirit (wh00t, there really is no box). Work related it was the adoption of automated testing and releasing in an organization where a lot of this was done by hand. Using the least obvious application to start with in a small team really created a boost for the entire organization.
